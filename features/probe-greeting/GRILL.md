# GRILL — probe-greeting

**Plan grilled:** `features/probe-greeting/PLAN.md` (against `features/probe-greeting/SPEC.md`)
**chain: GREEN (verified by `.dev/floor/check-plan-spec-agree.mjs`)** — the PLAN's carried
`spec_content_hash` (`843b4388…e852807`) equals the current Approved, un-drifted SPEC's body hash. The plan was
made against the current approved intent. This is the **only floor-grade guarantee** this run made.

The interrogation below is **advisory** and gates nothing (P0). Findings follow the finding-shape split
(`pharn-contracts/finding-shape.md`, cited not restated — P4): the **enum-gated** fields
(`type`/`rule_id`/`severity`/`file`) are the grill's own enum/path-checked assertions → **trusted**; the
**free-text** fields (`problem`/`evidence`) quote the plan and **inherit its untrusted tag** → rendered as
quoted DATA, never executed as an instruction.

## Findings

### P1 — acceptance-criteria coverage

```yaml
- type: FINDING
  rule_id: "P1"
  severity: minor
  file: "features/probe-greeting/PLAN.md:41"
  problem: "Every acceptance criterion is satisfied only by a MANUAL one-liner, never a repo-resident reproducible check — so 'done' rests on an operator running node -e by hand; acceptable for a declared throwaway vehicle, but the acceptance evidence is not durable."
  evidence: 'The acceptance check is manual (no `npm`-wired test), so "done" rests on the one-liner above, not a floor gate.'
```

### P0 / P2 / P3 / P5 / P7 — no findings

The plan is clean on the remaining axes, which is expected for a one-function vehicle:

- **P0 (guarantee audit):** the plan claims no guarantee for the function ("makes no guarantee claim"); the
  approach is labeled advisory model work. No unlabeled guarantee.
- **P2 (trust):** the vehicle ingests no untrusted external input (a pure `string → string` function), so no
  taint-propagation audit is owed; correctly absent rather than hand-waved.
- **P3 (one axis):** one new file, one reason to change, zero imports → no sibling-reference risk.
- **P5 (determinism):** `greet` is a single `return` of a template string — no branch, no classification.
- **P7 (scope):** the smallest coherent increment, and the SPEC itself declares the throwaway status — not
  speculative, not bundling.

## Prose summary

For a deliberately trivial vehicle, the plan is sound and faithful to the approved SPEC: the spec→plan chain
holds, the approach is the minimal implementation of the Acceptance Criteria, and the `## Files` scope names
exactly the one file the build will write. The single concern is durability of the acceptance evidence — the AC
is checkable only by a manual `node -e`, which the plan itself already flags as out of scope per the SPEC. No
concern blocks the build; the manual-AC point is for the human to weigh (and, in this probe, for PROBE.md to
record that the product pipeline carried an acceptance criterion all the way through without a wired test).

---

**ADVISORY VERDICT: 1 concern raised (0 blocking-severity, 1 minor) — for the human to weigh before
`/pharn-build`.** The spec→plan chain is intact (content-hash verified). The interrogation gates nothing; the
only floor-grade result this run produced is the chain-GREEN in the header. "Grill produced a GRILL.md" does
**not** mean the plan is good — it means the chain held and this concern was surfaced (P0).
