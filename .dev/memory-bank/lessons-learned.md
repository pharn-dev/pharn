# Lessons learned

Canonical memory-bank state (`ARCHITECTURE.md §5`). Each entry is promoted by a **gated** `/review` or `/build`
action and carries **provenance** (run / feature / diff); promotion to canon is never silent (P2). The
other three canonical files (`architecture-context`, `feature-catalog`, `pattern-library`) are created
when first needed, not speculatively (P7).

## L1 — `/plan` must scope the meta-docs an increment invalidates

**Lesson.** When an increment changes a fact asserted in a meta-doc — `CLAUDE.md` test/command counts,
`CHANGELOG.md`, the root `README.md` — `/plan` must name that meta-doc in its _Files_ list, or `/build`
ships stale canon (it writes only the files the plan names). Add a meta-doc sweep to the `/plan`
discovery step (P6): after scoping the built artifacts, ask _"which meta-docs state a fact this
increment changes?"_ and include them.

**Why it matters.** Stale canon in `CLAUDE.md` misleads every future session — it is injected as project
instructions; a missing `CHANGELOG` entry breaks the file's own "all notable changes are documented"
contract. The floor cannot catch this: `validate.mjs` does not scan meta-docs, so it is an advisory gap
that only `/review` surfaces — exactly how this lesson was found.

**Provenance.**

- feature: `structural-checker`
- diff: commit `0de6f7b` — added a third `node --test` suite (5 → 11 tests) and a new floor command,
  without updating `CLAUDE.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`.
- surfaced by: `features/structural-checker/REVIEW.md` — findings **F2** (`CLAUDE.md:60` asserted "5
  tests" vs live 11) and **F3** (missing `CHANGELOG` `[Unreleased]` entry).
- promoted: 2026-06-24 via gated `/review` (human-approved).

## L2 — A contract's honesty must travel with the artifact, and may cite only live floor ops

**Lesson.** When a `/build` amends a contract with a normative `MUST`, two checks must pass at
`/review`: (1) the PLAN's `## Guarantee audit (P0)` honesty (what is advisory vs floor-enforced) must
be written **into the artifact**, not just the PLAN — the PLAN is ephemeral, the contract is durable;
(2) any "enforced by `<floor op>`" phrase must cite an op that is **live**, verified by reading the
implementation this run (P6), not merely spec'd. A contract can faithfully cite the spec (P4) and
still import an unbacked guarantee when the cited floor op (at the time, fix #7 / the writes-scope
guard) is unimplemented.

**Why it matters.** This is the core P0 disease ("written in the contract" ≠ "guaranteed") reproduced
inside PHARN's own contracts. `validate.mjs` cannot catch it — it checks structure, not prose honesty
— so only `/review`, reading the live hook + validate.mjs, surfaces it. The remedy is a `/review`
sub-check: for every new `MUST`/"enforced by" in a contract, confirm a live floor reduction or an
explicit `advisory` label.

**Provenance.**

  and F2 (`ARCHITECTURE.md:73` cites fix #7 writes-scope guard; `protect-trusted-paths.cjs` implements
  only fix #2). The cited gap (fix #7) has since landed — see L3.
- promoted: 2026-06-25 via gated `/review` (human-approved).

## L3 — Making a declarative field load-bearing requires re-auditing every existing declaration of it

**Lesson.** When an increment turns a previously-advisory declarative field (here `writes:`) into a
floor-enforced gate, the SAME increment must audit every existing value of that field against where the
workflow actually writes. A declaration that was harmless while advisory (`/review`'s
`writes: ["REVIEW.md"]`) becomes a guaranteed block the moment it is enforced and the real artifact
lives elsewhere (`features/<name>/REVIEW.md`): the guard then denies the correct path while permitting
nothing useful.

**Why it matters.** Fail-closed enforcement is only safe if the declarations it reads are already true.
Retrofitting enforcement onto a field that drifted from reality converts latent doc-vs-repo drift (P6)
into active, guaranteed friction — and the friction lands on the next operator, not the author.
`validate.mjs` cannot catch it (it checks structure, not declaration-vs-usage), so only `/review`,
running the new guard live, surfaces it. Remedy: a `/review` sub-check — when a field becomes
load-bearing, diff every declaration of it against actual usage in the same increment.

**Provenance.**

## L4 — An authored fixture passes by construction; a live capability must be measured

**Lesson.** A capability's eval fixture (`evals/expected/*`) is **authored to pass** — it proves the
CHECK is shaped right, never that the live capability satisfies it. Do not trust that a capability does
what its fixture says until you measure it **live** (`/pharn-eval`: run the real LLM N times, then count
structural pass/fail with `floor/check-variance.mjs`). The **structural/semantic split** (`eval-format`,
cited per P4) is what **localized** the defect: in the trust-fence attempt-0 before-run, run 5 was
structural-**FAIL** (the enum-gated `file` cited the injection-comment line `:16`, not the destructive
op `:20`) **and** semantic-**PASS** (reasoning sound — blocking grounded in the unenforced authz, the
comment named as an attack) _simultaneously_. A single LLM-judge assertion would have been **masked by
the semantic pass**, leaving the wrong-line emission invisible; splitting the floor-checkable structural
row from the advisory semantic judge is what made the miss a deterministic RED. **"Authored-fixture ≠
live capability" is the empirical form of "written ≠ guaranteed"** (P0).

**Why it matters.** This is the repo's core P0 disease ("written in the contract" ≠ "therefore
guaranteed") reproduced at the eval layer: a green fixture reads as "the capability works," but it only
proves the assertion is well-formed. `floor/validate.mjs` confirms the fixture EXISTS and binds its
`rule_id` (P1) — it cannot run the LLM, so it cannot catch a capability that passes its authored
expected yet drifts live. Only `/pharn-eval` (live emission + `check-variance` counting) closes that
gap, and only the structural/semantic split keeps a structural miss from hiding behind a semantic pass.
Remedy: treat a built + fixture-green capability as **plumbing-in-place, not proven** — the proof is the
live measurement, and that measurement must keep the floor-grade structural rows separate from the
advisory semantic ones.

  this one via gated `/build` per the `/build` instruction — the gate that makes it non-silent is fix #7
  (writes-scope) + per-entry provenance (`ARCHITECTURE.md §5`), not the command name.

## L5 — A floor verdict is only as trustworthy as the orchestration that captures its inputs

**Lesson.** A pipeline stage's deterministic FLOOR verdict (`/regress`, `/verify` — exit-code
comparisons) is only as trustworthy as the ADVISORY orchestration that captures its inputs: the exit
codes and file lists are assembled by the command's Bash, and that assembly can silently corrupt them.
Treat input-capture as a trust boundary — make it robust and self-checking (array-expand or quote shell
lists; assert the expected cardinality; fail-closed on a surprising shape) — and never read a green
floor verdict as a guarantee without accounting for how its inputs were produced.

**Why it matters.** The "two clocks" split (the verdict is floor-grade; the orchestration that feeds it
is advisory) has teeth: a verdict computed over corrupted inputs is GIGO, not a guarantee — the P0
disease ("written" ≠ "guaranteed") reproduced one layer up, at the input boundary. Concretely, on the
first full-pipeline run `/regress`'s `tests` gate ran `node --test $LIST` with an unquoted variable
under zsh (the macOS default shell, which does **not** word-split unquoted expansions); the whole list
was passed as a single bogus path → "could not find" → exit 1 at **both** base and head. Being equal on
both sides it evaded a false _regression_ (1 == 1, classified pre-existing), but it fabricated a
pre-existing red and would have **masked** a real tests-gate regression. The floor core
(`check-regress.mjs`) was correct; its inputs were not. The remedy lives in the orchestration layer, not
the floor.

## L6 — Membership/structural facts are read from the structured location, never grepped from free text

**Lesson.** A structural or membership fact — "does this capability declare `role: verifier`?", "what
paths does this plan write?" — is read from its STRUCTURED location (the `---`-fenced YAML frontmatter, an
enum, `package.json`), never pattern-matched as a substring over file contents. The enum-gated vs free-text
split (fix #1) governs MEMBERSHIP DETECTION, not only finding emission: a `role: verifier` string in prose
or a fenced code block is DATA about verifiers, not a declaration of one. A substring grep over contents is
not a membership test — it conflates documentation with declaration.

**Why it matters.** A prose-matching membership check is monotonically unstable: it silently grew from a
predicted 3 to 8 matches as the repo accumulated prose mentioning `role: verifier` (none real
declarations), so `/verify` could believe verifiers exist when none do, or run garbage over them. This is
the P0 disease ("written" mistaken for "declared/guaranteed") at the membership layer — the same discipline
as the scope-setter reading `## Files` structurally (fix #15) and the finding object's enum-gated vs
free-text split (fix #1). Remedy: read membership deterministically from the structured field
(`floor/count-verifiers.mjs` parses the frontmatter fence and counts `role === "verifier"`); reserve free
text for human-facing DATA. Complements L5.

## L7 — A stage's writes: must equal exactly what it writes — never declare a downstream gate's target upstream

**Lesson.** A pipeline stage's `writes:` declaration must list exactly the paths the stage's own code
writes this run — nothing aspirational, and never the target of a _downstream_ gated action. Declaring
`memory-bank/lessons-learned.md` in `/review`'s `writes:` made the fix #7 setter resolve a two-path scope
the pre-write hook then PERMITTED, silently granting `/review` a direct, ungated canon write — the very
power `/memory-promote`'s `check-provenance` + human accept exist to withhold. A stage that only _proposes_
a lesson must not hold write-scope to canon; route the gated write through the dedicated command, which
declares that path itself.

**Why it matters.** fix #7's guarantee — that a stage may write only its declared outputs — is only as
tight as the declaration it reads; an over-declaration is permissive in the _dangerous_ direction (the
same class as the #15 scope-setter `## Files` leak, and the inverse of L3's too-narrow friction). It is the
P0 disease one layer up: the gate is real, yet a stage can be handed a power the gate was built to withhold
simply by naming the gate's target in its own `writes:`. The floor cannot catch a per-command
over-declaration on its own — `validate.mjs` ignores `.claude/`, and nothing enumerates every command's
`writes:` for canon paths (a named, P7-eligible residual). Remedy: declare only real outputs; keep canon
writable solely through `/memory-promote`; and pin the resolved scope with a test (set-equality to the real
outputs) so a future re-widening fails closed. Complements L3 (same field, opposite failure direction) and
L5/L6 (a floor verdict or membership test is only as trustworthy as the declarations and inputs it reads).

## L8 — The writes-scope setter resolves one --target — favor single-file command outputs

**Lesson.** `set-writes-scope.cjs` narrows a placeholder `writes:` entry to exactly ONE concrete `--target`
path per call, and each call OVERWRITES `.pharn/writes-scope.json`. A command that emits ≥2 artifacts under
placeholder paths therefore cannot scope them all in a single setter call — only the entry matching `--target`
survives; the others are filtered out and the fix #7 pre-write hook then DENIES them. When designing a new
command's outputs, prefer a SINGLE scopeable file (fold metadata into it); if two artifacts are genuinely
needed, re-scope per-artifact — call the setter once immediately before each write, as `/pharn-dev-regress` and
`/pharn-dev-verify` do. Never assume one setter call authorizes a multi-file placeholder output.

**Why it matters.** fix #7's fail-closed guarantee is only ergonomic if a command's real outputs are
scopeable; a multi-artifact command under placeholder paths silently loses scope on all-but-one output (the
hook denies the rest), so the design pressure is toward single-file outputs or explicit per-artifact
re-scoping. This shaped `/pharn-spec`: the approved-intent content-hash lives IN `SPEC.md` frontmatter
(computed over the body — non-circular) rather than a sidecar `SPEC.lock.json`, keeping the command's output
to one scopeable path. It is a setter MECHANIC constraining command DESIGN — a new axis on the `writes:`/scope
subsystem of L3 (a too-narrow declaration becomes friction) and L7 (an over-broad declaration leaks power),
both of which concern a declaration's CONTENT; this concerns the setter's RESOLUTION shape. Honest trigger
(P7): the constraint was learned at design time and the sidecar friction was AVOIDED, not hit — surfaced by
reading `set-writes-scope.cjs` live, not by a dogfood failure.

## L9 — An increment's own markdown style is gated by neither /pharn-dev-regress nor /pharn-dev-verify

**Lesson.** The per-increment deterministic gates leave the increment's OWN markdown style ungated.
`/pharn-dev-regress` deterministically SKIPS the style gates (`format:check` / `lint:md`) unless the change
touches a shared style config — over outside files byte-identical at base and head a style result cannot
flip, so the skip is sound — and `/pharn-dev-verify`'s canonical gate map (`test` / `validate` / `lint` /
`structural`) OMITS them. So a style regression in an increment's own new files — a command edit, or the
pipeline's own `.dev/features/<name>/*` audit artifacts — passes BOTH stages and surfaces only at the full
`npm run check` (or CI). Remedy: add `format:check` + `lint:md` to `/pharn-dev-verify`'s canonical gate map;
`/pharn-dev-verify` runs only at HEAD with devDeps present, so the style gates are cheap (no `npm ci`) and
make the verify verdict track the full `npm run check`.

**Why it matters.** Each stage's omission is individually defensible — regress proves a style flip
impossible without a shared-config change; verify's four gates target 'is it green with this in it' — but
the SEAM between them is unowned: the increment's own NEW markdown is checked by neither. That is the P0
disease in coverage form — 'the gates passed' read as 'the increment is clean' when `npm run check` (the
documented aggregate, GREEN at baseline) was RED. Concretely this run: the `plan-files-scope` build output
plus its PLAN / GRILL / regression-report artifacts failed `format:check`, and PLAN.md failed `lint:md`
(MD038 spaces-in-code-span, from embedding a back-tick-laden regex in prose, plus MD049 emphasis), yet
`/pharn-dev-regress` returned `no-regressions` (style gates skipped — inside touched no shared config) and
`/pharn-dev-verify`'s four canonical gates were green; only the full `npm run check` was RED, caught and
fixed by hand at verify. The remedy lives in the orchestration layer (`/pharn-dev-verify`'s gate map), not
the floor checker — complements L5 (a floor verdict is only as trustworthy as the inputs the orchestration
captures).

## L10 — Product-pipeline artifacts sit on the validate-SCANNED surface; `.dev/` dev artifacts don't

**Lesson.** The dev/product boundary is symmetric on the WRITE side (dev artifacts → `.dev/features/`, product
artifacts → root `features/`) but ASYMMETRIC at the floor's SCAN side: `validate.mjs` `EXCLUDE_SEGMENTS`
excludes `.dev/` wholesale but NOT root `features/`. So a finding-bearing PRODUCT artifact (e.g. a `/pharn-grill`
`GRILL.md` emitting `rule_id:` + `problem:`) is subject to validate CHECK 5 (fix #1 — it must document the
enum-gated / free-text split or trip RED), whereas the equivalent DEV artifact (`/pharn-dev-grill`'s `GRILL.md`
in excluded `.dev/features/`) is never scanned. Consequence: moving the same pipeline from the dev loop to the
product loop silently subjects its audit artifacts to a floor check they never faced — the first real
product-pipeline run can RED validate for an artifact reason unrelated to the user's code. Remedy: either
exclude finding-bearing product pipeline artifacts from validate's scan (mirroring the `.dev/` exclusion), or
ensure the `pharn-*` commands emit split-documented findings by construction (the `/pharn-grill` command already
instructs honoring the split — making it load-bearing for the floor, not just style).

**Why it matters.** The STYLE-gate half of this same dev/product asymmetry (product artifacts also face
`format:check` + `lint:md` at `/pharn-dev-verify`) is L9's territory — verify's style gates now cover them; THIS
lesson is the validate-CHECK-5 half, which L9 does not touch. Note the trust UPSIDE: a laundered needle in a
product `GRILL.md`'s enum-gated field WOULD be caught by CHECK 5, so the asymmetry also closes a real gap — the
only cost is that benign product findings must document the split. Surfaced live by the product-pipeline-probe:
the product `/pharn-grill` `GRILL.md` landed on the scanned surface and passed CHECK 5 only because the split was
documented; a bare-findings `GRILL.md` would have RED'd the floor.
