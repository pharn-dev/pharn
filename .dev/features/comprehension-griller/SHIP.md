# SHIP — comprehension-griller (advisory roll-up)

`/pharn-dev-ship` ran the gated build loop for the **comprehension griller** (the twelfth griller — the
"will the next person understand WHY, not just WHAT" / comprehension-debt axis, advisory-only beyond
membership). This is a thin roll-up; it records **that the chain ran and its floor verdicts** — it is
**not** a judgment that the increment is good, and **not** a "shipped" / seal.

## Stages run, in order, and where the run ended

| # | stage             | outcome                                                                 |
| - | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `/pharn-dev-plan`   | PLAN.md written; **GATE 1** — human **approved as written**             |
| 2 | `/pharn-dev-grill`  | GRILL.md — advisory, gates nothing; 3 concerns (0 blocking) → proceeded  |
| 3 | `/pharn-dev-build`  | 7 product files written; floor **GREEN** → proceeded                    |
| 4 | `/pharn-dev-regress`| regression-report.json → proceeded                                      |
| 5 | `/pharn-dev-verify` | verify-report.json → proceeded                                          |
| 6 | `/pharn-dev-review` | REVIEW.md — **GATE 2** (chain end); handed to human                     |

**Ended at GATE 2** (post-review human decision), not at a RED-verdict STOP.

## The structural floor verdicts read (verbatim — these are the guarantees; reading them is advisory)

- **`/pharn-dev-build`** → `node .dev/floor/validate.mjs .` exit **0** (GREEN; 13 capabilities,
  `count-grillers` → 12, comprehension registered — the +1 landed with **zero** floor edits).
- **`/pharn-dev-regress`** → `regression-report.json` `.verdict` = **`no-regressions`** (every outside gate
  `tests`/`validate`/`structural:trust-fence` 0→0).
- **`/pharn-dev-verify`** → `verify-report.json` `.verdict` = **`PASS`** (gates `test`/`validate`/`lint`/
  `format:check`/`lint:md` all 0; 0 verifiers registered → floor-only).

Each verdict belongs to its **sub-stage's** own checker; `/pharn-dev-ship` added **no** new floor primitive
(gated mode) — it read these and proceeded. Reading-and-proceeding is advisory orchestration.

## Pointers (cited, not restated — P4)

- `.dev/features/comprehension-griller/GRILL.md` — advisory interrogation (documentation-overlap co-fire;
  two eval-quality notes).
- `.dev/features/comprehension-griller/REVIEW.md` — 4 lenses, **GREEN** (0 floor-gate, 2 advisory-minor);
  carries a **proposed** lesson candidate for a separate human-gated `/pharn-dev-memory-promote`.

## One deviation from a clean straight-through run (disclosed)

- **`/pharn-dev-verify` first FAILED `format:check`** on two files I had just authored
  (`comprehension.md`, `REGRESSION.md` — prose-wrap only, both in the increment's declared scope). I
  applied a deterministic, zero-judgment `prettier --write` to exactly those two files (fixture line
  `plan-comprehension-debt.md:17` confirmed untouched) and re-ran **all** gates, which then passed. No
  gate was bypassed; the underlying formatting was actually fixed. Full detail in `VERIFY.md`.
- **`/pharn-dev-regress` capture correction:** an initial word-splitting bug in my ad-hoc capture mislabeled
  the GREEN `tests` gate as red (identically at base and head, so no false regression); corrected, and the
  proposed lesson candidate in `REVIEW.md` records the trap. Detail in `REGRESSION.md`.

## Standing decision is the human's

Chain ran; the named floor verdicts are as shown (build GREEN · regress `no-regressions` · verify `PASS`;
review GREEN advisory) — **this is NOT a judgment that the increment is good or wise; that is the human's
call at the post-review gate.** `/pharn-dev-ship` does not merge, push, commit, or apply the
`PHARN ✓ reviewed` seal.
